// Iteration 6: Alphabetic Order - Order by title and print the first 20 titles
// Another popular way to order the movies is to sort them alphabetically using the title key.
// However, in this case, we only need to print the title of the first 20. Easy peasy for an expert like you. üòâ

// Create an orderAlphabetically() function that receives an array and returns an array of the first 20 titles,
// alphabetically ordered. Return only the title of each movie, and if the array you receive has less than 20 movies, return all of them.

// ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Your function should return a new array, containing movie objects sorted alphabetically.
// Your function should not modify (mutate) the original array. You may need to research how to make a "copy" or "clone" an array.
function orderAlphabetically(moviesArray) {
    const moviesByYear = [...moviesArray.sort((a,b) => a.title.localeCompare(b.title))]; // use logic from iteration #5 to clone array entered as a parameter and order alphabetically 
    const listOfTitles = moviesByYear.map(film => film.title); // use logic from iteration #1 to map cloned array, modify it and return a list of titles

    }
    else {
        return listOfTitles; // return entire list of movie titles
    }
}

// BONUS - Iteration 7: Time Format - Turn duration of the movies from hours to minutes
// We got the info from the IMDB web page, but the duration info was
// saved in a format that is difficult for us to compare movies.

// Finding the longest movie is almost impossible
// using that format, so let's change it!

// Create a turnHoursToMinutes() function that receives an array as
// a parameter and, with some magic implemented by you - replaces
// the duration info of each of the movies for its equivalent in minutes.

// For example:
// {
//   "title": "The Shawshank Redemption",
//   "year": 1994,
//   "director": "Frank Darabont",
//   "duration": "2h 22min",
//   "genre": ["Crime","Drama"],
//   "score" :9.3
// }
// Should be:

// {
//   "title": "The Shawshank Redemption",
//   "year": 1994,
//   "director": "Frank Darabont",
//   "duration": 142,
//   "genre": ["Crime","Drama"],
//   "score": 9.3
// }

// ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Your function should return a new array, containing movieobjects
// with the duration time in minutes. Your function should not
// modify (mutate) the original array.

function turnHoursToMinutes(moviesArray) {
    const newListOfAllMovies = [...moviesArray];
    return newListOfAllMovies;
}

// BONUS - Iteration 8: Best yearly score average - Best yearly score average
// We always hear so much about classic movies, but we want to
// know which year has the best average score so that we can
// declare the BEST YEAR FOR CINEMA officially!

// Go ahead and find which year has the best average score for
// the movies released that year! Create bestYearAvg() function that
// receives an array of movies and gives us an answer to which year
// was the best year for cinema and what was its average score.
// The bestYearAvg() should return a string with the following structure:

// The best year was <YEAR> with an average score of <RATE>

function bestYearAvg(moviesArray) {
    if (moviesArray.length ===0) {
        return null;
    }
}
